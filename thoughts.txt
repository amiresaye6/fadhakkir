// notes //
 we need to store the reels on owr own storage to provide consistancy, so ther will be two steps
 fist we need to get all teh reels we want to add to our queue
 then download them all, upload them all to the google drive, store all the reels data including the direct url of the reels
 from our storage instad of instagram's one, and then this resulting json file shold be appendable, each time we add new reels,
 this file will be updated,
 second, i should modify automaticPosting.js file to loop over the "overall" json file that we just created instead of calling the
 instagram fetch data function each time.

 waht i need to do,
 1/ create the new script that will fetch data, download it, upload it to google drive
 2/ update automaticPosting.js to handle this json file and add error messages support.
